# BookTrack

BookTrack is a personal project made to help me get books to read and track what books I am currently reading in my stack.

It uses React and Tailwind for frontend and Supabase for backend. The AI integration relies on Google Gemini, while strictly formatting its output response to precisely match the format I want.

This project is still ongoing
